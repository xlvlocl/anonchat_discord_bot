# ⚠️ Project Disclaimer  

This is one of my first projects. It lacks a clear structure and is hardly applicable in any practical scenario you can imagine. You may use this code **only for educational purposes** (well, at least that's what I think).  

## 🛠 Project Status  
As the developer, due to an extreme lack of time, this project is in the **"Almost Closed"** stage. A tremendous amount of effort was poured into it, but the bot received almost no support—just like its developer.  

However, out of respect for the users, I cannot completely abandon it. Therefore:  
- The bot will **likely remain online**  
- I may occasionally add minor features **as time permits**  
- **Do not expect any major updates**  

## 🔗 Try It Yourself  
You can join the Discord server and test the bot yourself—it's still online at the time of writing.
